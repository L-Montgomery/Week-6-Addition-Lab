## Lab Questions
### Summary
In this lab we combined an XOR gate, an adder and a full adder to show how addition works with two bit. This was then connected to a basys 3 board that demonstrated how carry bits work using LEDs.
### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
You add multiple full adders so that the carry of the first adder is the input for the next adder.
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The importance of the XOR gate in an adder is that it determines what the sum bit correctly. 
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder can handle is 3. What happens when you go over it will only show the lowest two bits. Anything above three requires a carry out bit.
